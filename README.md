## Overview

CryptoFlow collects cryptocurrency price data from multiple exchanges, aggregates it, caches it, and makes it accessible via a REST API. A beautiful built-in frontend lets users view real-time prices.

### Features
- **Hexagonal Architecture**
- Real-Time & Historical **Price Stats**
- Supports **Live/Test Mode** switching via API
- Uses **Redis** for real-time cache and **PostgreSQL** for aggregates
- Built-in **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS Frontend**
- Dockerized and easy to run

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- Docker

### Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Temutjin2k/CryptoFlow.git
cd CryptoFlow

# Load Exchange Images
docker load -i exchanges/exchange1_amd64.tar
docker load -i exchanges/exchange2_amd64.tar
docker load -i exchanges/exchange3_amd64.tar

# Copy .env.example file to .env file
cp .env.example .env

docker compose up --build
```

## Postman Collection

You can find a ready-to-use Postman collection inside the `api/` directory:

```
api/CryptoFlow.postman_collection.json
```

Import this collection into Postman to quickly test all available endpoints including switching modes, fetching price stats, and running health checks.

## Concurrency Implementation and Patterns:
This project heavily relies on concurrency to handle large volumes of real-time data. Key concurrency patterns that were used include:

- **Fan-in:** Aggregating multiple market data streams into a single channel for centralized processing.

- **Fan-out:** Distributing incoming data updates to multiple workers to process them in parallel.

- **[Worker Pool](https://gobyexample.com/worker-pools):** Managing a set of workers that process live updates efficiently, ensuring balanced workload distribution.

- **Generator:** Implementing a generator to produce synthetic market data for `Test Mode`.
